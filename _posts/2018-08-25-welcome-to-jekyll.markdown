This class is all about creative coding practice that tries to see how we can use coding as a tool to make interesting works on language that don't exist before.
You don't hate coding & basic understanding of computation and programming (variables, string, for loop..., basic html css javascript)
p5js, ml5js, RiTa -> artist toolkit, basic, easy to learn, good enough for you to be creative but if you feel more comfortable to use python/C/whatever language you already know, feel free to do so.
