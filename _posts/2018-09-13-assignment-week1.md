    <small>These are some principles for you to consider through out the whole semester. Try to keep language in mind as you read through it. What are the similarities between language and digital media? How do artists engage with these tendencies in the following art examples?</small>

<h6>Writing Response</h6>

* Write a response for all the readings and artworks. Keep the length around 200 words.

It could be an art project, an article, a youtube video or even a research paper. You can also write about your example with other materials in your writing response , but it is not necessary.
