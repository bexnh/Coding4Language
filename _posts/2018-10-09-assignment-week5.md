### Experiment
* Create a text sculpture either in the virtual 3D or in the physical space (bring the object or present the documentation)
* Try to cover at least three keywords on your list

### Reading:
* Read [“What is Codework?”](http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0605/msg00037.html) by Alan Sondheim
* Read [these pages from Course in General Linguistics](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1A8wKpX9biIS8W5XE165imUR_uXM51aG5): Basic linguistic theory and terminologies
* Read Chapter 2 “Speech, Writing, Code: Three Worldviews” in *My Mother Was a Computer*.
* [Recommended] [An interview with Mez Breeze](http://rhizome.org/editorial/2016/dec/15/mezangelle-an-online-language-for-codework-and-poetry/) by Aria Dean on Rhizome.

### Art
Spend some time "reading":
* [Mezangelle](https://anthology.rhizome.org/mez-breeze), Mez Breeze
* [Jodi](http://www.jodi.org/), Joan Heemskerk and Dirk Paesmans (Refresh the page several times!)

### Questions to think about:
* Is computer code language? (Is “programming language” an oxymoron?)
* Who are the addressees for Codework?
* How Codework is to be grasped as an linguistic object?
