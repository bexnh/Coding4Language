**Due 4PM October 22**  
### Experiment
* Mix or blend language and code (programming language & other possibilities?) in a creative way.
* Possible directions to go: ambiguity, poetics, following/breaking a certain structure, différance...
* For anyone who don’t feel comfortable with programming languages, I would suggest you picking a code system that you are familiar with. There are many different code systems out there in our life, following a specific format or a set of rules. A few examples: bar code, zip code, time stamps, morse code, music notations etc… Think about the rules this particular code system is using and see whether you can use language to ‘hack’ it or use that code system to challenge language.

### Art
* TBD

### Reading:
* [Cultural Data: Possibilities and limitations of the digital data universe](http://manovich.net/content/04-projects/102-cultural-data/cultural_data_article.pdf)
* A manifesto: ["Data Will Help Us"](http://datawillhelp.us/)
<!-- * surveillance capitalism? -->
<!-- * [How to think about bots?](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qkzpdm/how-to-think-about-bots) -->

### Questions
* When do language become data?
* How does internet influence our perception of language/society/humanity?
* How could we make creative and ethical use of all the enormous corpora of language online?
