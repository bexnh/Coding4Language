### Experiment
* Create a DLA project that meets at least one of the following requirements
1. Show casing a data set in a creative way
2. Use content (primarily text) from Internet as your raw material / playground
* Try to keep the project small. If you have a good idea that sounds more like a final project, you can implement a prototype/demo at this stage
