### Experiment
* Translate a digital language art project into another language or another media
* You can decide the way you want to translate it: Literal translation, homophonic translation, or translating like a bird (Read [Thie poem is a nomad](https://schloss-post.com/this-poem-is-a-nomad/) for how an example of translating like a bird)

### Final Project Proposal
* Your project proposal should include the following:
    * Project title (it could be temporary but you must have one)
    * A 100-words project summary
    * Keywords: at least 2 keywords or more
    * Do you want to show your work on Wednesday 12/12 (We will talk more about it in class)?
    * Details: this part is rather flexible, here are some questions to think about for your reference:
        * Concept: What is your project idea? Why do you want to do it? What does it tell us about language/or the relationship between language and technology?
        * Implementation: What is the 'digital' aspect of your work? What technology/tools are you going to use?
        * Inspirations & References: Conceptual, technical, artistic, visual...
        * Project Plan: Have you done any early experiment related to the project? What do you still need to learn/work on to make your piece?  What's the challenge? Are there different possibilities you would like to explore with your final project? Try to come up with a rough project schedule.
        * If it is a collaboration, how are you going to divide the workload?
        * Any other related material


* Project proposal should be posted online by the deadline. This also apply to those who can't attend the project proposal presentations.
