### Final Project Process
* Write about your initial attempt/process made for your final project. It could be a more developed project idea, writings, research, early stage experiment, or visual mockups.
* Please use that as a chance to gather materials for your final documentation/presentation.

### Optional Reading
* [The 'Criticism' chapter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wMkKZzkBw14oif6Dkq_uThINA_ZMMS-M/view?usp=sharing) from the book *Microlectures In Proximity of Performance*, by Matthew Goulish: a very inspiring text about art critic, which I hope will help us with the workshop sessions for the next two classes.
