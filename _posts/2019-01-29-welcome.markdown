#### Coding tutorials for Beginners
If you have absolutely no coding experience before, I recommend you to work through [this course on codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-how-to-code). You can learn about key programming concepts such as variables, functions, and control flow. Learning these concepts will set you up in any programming language that you choose to learn later! It always takes some time to start thinking like a programmer.
