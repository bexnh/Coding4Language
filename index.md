**Course #: LITR 0310L Section S01** <br>
**Time: Tuesday 4pm-6:30pm** <br>
**Location: Page-Robinson Hall 403** <br>

In a time when almost every word and sentence are digitized by computers, language becomes programmable. In this project centered workshop we are going to explore what possibilities, questions and challenges programming bring to language, especially in reading and writing practices. For students who are interested in language, coding, poetics, and creative writing, youâ€™ll learn through doing, reading, discussing and collaborating on works in programmable media. Some previous experience with programming is desirable. If you have a basic understanding of programming and are willing to spend more time to code for language, this course is for you.
