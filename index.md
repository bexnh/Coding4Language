A Project-oriented workshop for writers, visual/sound artists, filmmakers and programmers who wish to explore language art in digital media. Course content covers aesthetic, technical and theoretical concerns arising at the intersection of code, language, and digital media art. Assignments and projects will focus primarily on textual media, but will also address sound, image, video, performance and installation. You'll learn through doing, reading, discussing and collaborating on works in various media.Â Coding experience is preferred but not required.
