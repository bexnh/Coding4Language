Please sign up for presentations [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZXP5Y2u4MbgwM_KZMIRswBQNS5wGiDx4AGXsN6ALnMY/edit?usp=sharing)

* Choose an artist from the [list](http://introfall2018.dlarts.xyz/resources/) for presentation.

* You can also present an artist who is not on the list, but please email in advance to confirm it with me.

* You are only going to present one time in the whole semester.

* Some of the artists have a very wide range of art practices, so their works could be presented under different themes. Choose an artist you like and choose a time to present it. I will contact you if I found that your choice of time/theme is not appropriate for the artist. You can also propose to present the same artist in different weeks in the signup form.

* First come first served! There is a higher chance to get your first choice if you sign up early.
